\section{Comparison With Literature Values} %TODO: https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?alph for fsc, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00617498 for carrier density
\subsection{Charge Carrier Density}

The carrier concentrations found in \autoref{sec:ccd} do not lie close to values found in \cite{ccd}.
Saku et al. find carrier densities in the order of \SI{3e11}{\per\centi\meter\squared} at temperatures of around \SI{4}{\kelvin}.
They use modulation-doped AlGaAs-GaAs heterostructures with similar epitaxial layer sequences as in this experiment, shown in \autoref{fig:sakuccd}.
Nonetheless, carrier concentration is highly dependent on the doping of used materials, therefore, it is not possible to compare the results with literature values in a reasonable manner while lacking sample specifications.

\subsection{Fine-structure constant}
Comparing the values found for the fine-structure constant in \autoref{sec:fine} with literature values in \cite{NIST} confirms the plausibility of the results.
However, the literature value only lies within the error boundaries for the value found at \SI{2}{\kelvin} and \SI{100}{\micro\ampere} ($\alpha^{-1}_{\SI{2}{\kelvin},\SI{100}{\micro\ampere}} = \num{142.43(578)}$), featuring a relative deviation of \num{3.93}\%.

\section{Sources of Error} %TODO: Hot spots? --> iNvEsTiGaTe!!!
In the Quantum Hall Effect, the hall resistance shows quantized values, while the longitudinal resistance tends to vanish.
Therefore, the lines of constant electric potential must run parallel to the edges of the sample.
To match this potential curve at the contacts, where the equipotential lines run perpendicular to the edge, so called ''hot spots'' must be evoked in opposite corners at the contacts.
As a result of the drastic potential gradient at these locations, power is dissipated quickly, effectively heating up these spots.
This heat could be responsible for altering the quality of the 2DEG by exciting the electrons into higher states of the z-quantum well, introducing a source of error. %roll the credits.
