\chapter{Data and Procedure}

\section{Setup}
This experiment pursues to characterize a CdS semiconductor as a photoresistor.
Light from a polychromatic light source is focused on the photoresistor using a lens system.
Discrete and graduated color filters can be employed to illuminate the photoresistor with light of a specific wavelength only.
Polarizing filters are used to vary the level of illumination.
To measure the frequency dependence of photoconductivity, the polychromatic light source is replaced by a blue luminescence diode.
Its intensity is modulated sinusoidally with variable frequency.

\autoref{fig:iv} shows the recorded I-V characteristics for light wavelengths of \SI{549}{\nm} and \SI{647}{\nm}, as well as lab background/photoresistor noise measurements caused by either additional illumination of the photoresistor with stray lightrays in the setup (which do not originate from the intended light source) or by electronic noise.

It is easy to see that the background is negligably small.
The observed curves show the intended linear behavior (see Subfigures \ref{fig:iv-549} and \ref{fig:iv-647}).
The photoresistor's resistance clearly changes with the wavelength of incident light.
Performing linear regression yields resistances
\begin{align*}
  R(\lambda = \SI{549}{\nm}) = \SI{718}{\ohm} \\
  R(\lambda = \SI{647}{\nm}) = \SI{217}{\ohm}.
\end{align*}
The curve for $\lambda=\SI{549}{\nm}$ shows a point which reproducibly and inexplicably deviates from this linear dependence.

\subsection{Illuminance Dependency}

	\label{fig:intense-current}
\end{figure}
A pair of polarization filters, one of which can be rotated freely, is used to change the illuminance linearly.
\autoref{fig:intense-current} shows the measured photocurrent over illuminance.
Since the photocurrent is clearly proportional to the square root of illuminance, quadratic recombination of excess charge carriers is observed (as outlined in \autoref{sec:quad-recomb}).
We therefore conclude, that the concentration of equilibrium charge carriers is negligably small compared to excess carriers.

\subsection{Light Wavelength Dependency}
A wedge shaped interference filter on a screw-advance linear carriage is placed at one focal point of the optical train.
This filter is used to select different wavelengths of light from the halogen lamp used as the light source.
A pair of polarization filters is used to keep the light intensity constant, accounting for the non-uniform emission spectrum of the lamp.
The photocurrent shows a clear peak and a gaussian fit is used to find the exact center, as it doesn't seem to coincide exactly with a point.
The peak lies at $\lambda_\text{max} = \SI{540}{\nano\meter}$, which corresponds to a photon energy of $E = \frac{h c}{\lambda_\text{max}} = \SI{2.30}{\electronvolt}$.
This value is very close to the band gap of cadmium sulfide of \SI{2.42}{\electronvolt} at a relative deviation of \SI{5}{\percent}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Modulation Frequency Dependence}
The Photoresistor is illuminated by an LED, which is driven by a constant current with a shallow sinusoidal modulation superimposed.
This results in a very much not-sinusoidal current through the photoresistor.
A lock-in amplifier is used to measure the amplitude of the fundamental component of the photocurrent and also the phase with respect to the LED drive signal.

The amplitude of the fundamental is measured for multiple frequencies and shown in \autoref{fig:freq-current}.
Theoretically, the amplitude should be proportional to $|\Delta n(t)|$ (\autoref{eq:freq-dependence}).
This model does not fit the aquired data very well, so the corner frequency is determined by fitting a horizontal line to the points in log-log-space left of the corner frequency and a linear slope to the points right of the transition region.
The frequency where these lines intersect is $f_\text{i} = \SI{171}{\hertz}$ and corresponds the inverse of the mean charge carrier lifetime $\tau_\text{e} = \frac{1}{f_\text{i}} = \SI{5.8}{\milli\second}$.
