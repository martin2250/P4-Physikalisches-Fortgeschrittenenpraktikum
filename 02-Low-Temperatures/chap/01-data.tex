\chapter{Data}
\section{Temperature Dependence of Resistance}
The resistances of the temperature sensor and the three samples are displayed on four digital bench multimeters.
To ensure simultaneous readout of all values, the multimeters are recorded with a video camera and the video is paused to read off a set of values.

\section{Superconductor}
A heater is used to accurately sweep the temperature of the sample chamber.
To plot the resistance of the Nb sample against the resistance of the temperature sensor, an $x$-$y$ plotter is used.
This $T$-$R$ curve is recorded for magnetic fields from \SIrange{0}{0.6}{\tesla} in \SI{0.1}{\tesla} increments.
The temperature at which the sample becomes superconducting cannot be read off directly as the transition to zero resistance is not instantaneous, rather the steep slope between the residual resistance and zero resistance transitions into an asymptote to $R = 0$.
Thus, to get a repeatable measure of the transition temperature, the steep slope, which behaves approximately linearly, is extended to find it's intersection with $R = 0$, which is used as the temperature for each setting of the magnetic field.

\end{figure}
The resulting data is shown in \autoref{fig:Bc2-over-T}.
A linear regression of form $B_\text{C2}(T) = a + b \cdot T$ is used to find the parameters $a = \SI{5.37}{\tesla}$ and $b = \SI{-0.630}{\tesla\per\kelvin}$.
Comparing the orders in $T$ between the formulae given in the experiment instructions and rearranging for the coherence length $\xi_\text{GL}(T = 0)$ and mean free path $l$ yields
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	\xi_\text{GL}(T = 0) &= \sqrt{\frac{\Psi_0}{2 \uppi a}} &= \SI{7.83e-9}{\meter}\\
	l &= \frac{\xi^2_\text{GL}(T = 0)}{\SI{39}{\nano\meter}} &= \SI{1.57e-09}{\meter}
\end{alignat*}

\section{Semiconductor}
Plotting the logarithm of the conductivity of the silicon sample over the reciprocal temperature yields a curve similar to the theoretical curve shown in \autoref{fig:itscomplicated}.
Area $\upbeta$ contains significantly more samples than area $\upalpha$, so only the samples in $\upbeta$ are used for the linear fit.
The fit of the linearized data yields a conductance of
\begin{equation*}
	\sigma_\text{Si} = \sigma_\infty \cdot \exp\left(- \frac{E_2}{2 k T}\right),
\end{equation*}
with an activation energy of $E_2 = \SI{6.6e-3}{\eV}$ and $\sigma_\infty = \SI{5.11}{S\per\milli\meter}$.
This activation energy is small compared to the band gap energy of $E_\text{G} \approx \SI{1.1}{\eV}$, which is desirable in electronic applications.
