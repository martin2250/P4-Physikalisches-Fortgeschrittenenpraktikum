This experiment explores the electrical behavior of various conductors and semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures.

\section{Classical Electrical Conductivity}
The classical concept of free, localized electrons gives a simple explanation for electrical resistance, assuming that the electrons can scatter on the nuclei of the conductor material.
An external electric field $E$ accelerates the electrons with mass $m$, which regularly lose their kinetic energy to elastic collisions with nuclei.
The mean time between collisions $\tau$ depends on the parameters of the conductor's lattice structure.
Solving the equations of motion gives the term
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{m}{\tau} v_\text{D} = - e E
\end{equation*}
for the mean drift velocity $v_\text{D}$. The current density $j$ is given by $j = - e n v_\text{D}$, where $n$ denotes the density of electrons.
Using the definition of the conductance $j = \sigma E$, yields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:classical-resistance}
	\sigma = \frac{n e^2 \tau}{m}.
\end{equation}

\section{Temperature Dependence}
Most materials show a dependence on temperature in their electrical properties.
The density of free electrons $n$ in metals is independent of temperature, so the dependency must be in $\tau$, as the other variables in the RHS of \autoref{eq:classical-resistance} are constants.

In addition to the nuclei, electrons can also scatter on lattice defects and, more importantly, phonons, which are strongly associated with temperature.
The scattering processes are independent of each other, the total scattering rate $\tau^{-1}$ is calculated as the sum of the scattering rates due to phonons $\tau_\text{ph}^{-1}$ and nuclei/defects $\tau_\text{de}^{-1}$
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{1}{\tau_\text{ph}} + \frac{1}{\tau_\text{de}}.
\end{equation*}
Similarly, the specific resistance $\rho$ can be written as
\begin{equation*}
	\rho = \rho_\text{ph}(T) + \rho_\text{de},
\end{equation*}
the temperature independent $\rho_\text{de}$ is also called residual resistance, as it persists even at low temperatures, where phonon scattering is suppressed.

An exact term for $\rho_\text{ph}(T)$, calculated by Gr√ºneisen \cite{elresistancemetal}, is given by
\begin{equation}
	\rho_\text{ph}(T) = A \left(\frac{T}{\Theta}\right)^5 \cdot \int_0^\frac{\Theta}{T}\frac{x^5}{(\e^x - 1)(1 - \e^{-x})} \d x,
\end{equation}
where $\Theta$ denotes the debye temperature and $A$ is a material dependent constant.
For low temperatures $T \ll \Theta$ this function behaves like $T^5$, for higher $T$ a linear behavior emerges.

The resistance of a sample can be split up like the specific resistance as
\begin{equation*}
	R = R_\text{res} + R_\text{T}(T),
\end{equation*}
where $R_\text{res}$ denotes the residual resistance.

In the linear region the resistance approaches \cite{elresistancemetal}
\begin{equation}
	R_\text{T}(T) = \num{1.17} \cdot \frac{R_\Theta}{\theta} \cdot T - \num{0.17} \cdot R_\Theta,
\end{equation}
where $\rho_\Theta$ is the resistance at the debye temperature $\Theta$ (at least we think it does, the article is behind a paywall).
This facilitates a straightforward way to measure the debye temperature.
