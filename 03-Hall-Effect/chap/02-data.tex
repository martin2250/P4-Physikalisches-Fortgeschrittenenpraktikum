\chapter{Analysis of Data}

In what follows, we will analyze data for sample A and compare hall mobilities for both samples in the last section.

\section{Conductivity and Hall Coefficient}

  \label{fig:sample-a-product}
\end{figure}

The conductivity $\sigma$ of sample A is calculated as
\begin{equation*}
	\sigma = \frac{I}{U_\text{L}} \frac{l}{w h}
\end{equation*}
and the Hall coefficient $R_\text{H}$ is calculated as
\begin{equation*}
	R_\text{H} = \frac{E_\text{y}}{J_\text{x} B_\text{z}} = \frac{\frac{U_\text{H}}{l_\text{y}}}{\frac{I}{l_\text{y} \cdot l_\text{z}} B_\text{z}} = \frac{U_\text{H} l_\text{z}}{I B_\text{z}}
\end{equation*}
where $l_i$ denotes the sample's length along axis $i$, $E_\text{H}$ denotes the electric field created by the hall effect at a steady state, $B_\text{z}$ is the magnetic field along the z-axis and $I / J_\text{x}$ denote the current and -density along the x-axis.
$E$, $J$ and $B$ are perpendicular to each other, the coordinate system is chosen so that all quantities only have a component along one axis.

A plot of $\frac{1}{\left|R_\text{H}\right|}$ and $\sigma$ over $T$ is shown in \autoref{fig:sample-a-conductivity}.
The transition to the intrinsic region is clearly visible and it is estimated to start at \SI{320}{\kelvin}.
The end of the extrinsic region is better observed in a log-log-plot of the product $\sigma \cdot \left| R_\text{H} \right|$, shown in \autoref{fig:sample-a-product}.
It is estimated to end at \SI{270}{\kelvin}.

% \section{Conduction Type}
% The type of charge carriers in the extrinsic region is determined by looking at the extrinsic region in \autoref{fig:sample}.

\section{Intrinsic Charge Carrier Density}
\begin{figure}

	\label{fig:intr_carrier}
\end{figure}

Rearranging Equation (55) from the experiment manual yields the following relation between the charge carrier density $n_\text{i}$ and the hall coefficient $R_\text{H}$:
\begin{equation*}
	n_\text{i} \left(R_\text{H}\left( T \right), T \right) = \frac{1}{e \cdot \left|R_\text{H}\left(T\right)\right|} \frac{ 1 - b \left( T \right) }{ 1 + b \left( T \right) },
\end{equation*}
where the ratio of positive and negative charge carriers' mobilities
\begin{equation*}
	b \left( T \right) = \frac{\mu_\text{n}}{\mu_\text{p}} = \num{1.24553} + \num{0.00107} \cdot T,
\end{equation*}
is calculated using the empirical formula given in the experiment manual.

\autoref{fig:intr_carrier} shows the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_\text{i}$ as a function of temperature $T$.
The measured data obviously reflects the theoretical model, since the dependence is expected to be $\propto T^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}\cdot\e^{-\frac{E_\text{G}}{2k_\text{B}T}}$ as outlined in \autoref{sec:cc} (note that $n_\text{i}(T)$ is scaled logarithmically on the y-axis).

% The value of $n_\text{i}\left(T = \SI{300}{\kelvin}\right) = \SI{2.316e19}{\per\cubic\meter}$ is obtained by a linear interpolation between the closest measured values and not, despite the experiment manual's instructions, by using values for the y-intercept and $E_\text{g,0}$ from the Arrhenius plot (discussed in \autoref{sec:arrhenius}).
% The Arrhenius plot has been obtained by calculating $n_\text{i}(T)$ in the first place, so the best approach to obtain the intrinsic carrier concentration at \SI{300}{\kelvin} is using the original $n_\text{i}(T)$ dependence.

\section{Arrhenius Plot}\label{sec:arrhenius}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{./data/plots/arrhenius.pdf}
	\captiond{Arrhenius plot for sample A}{The expected linear dependence is easy to be seen.}
	\label{fig:arrhenius}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:arrhenius} shows an Arrhenius plot for sample A (discussed at the end of \autoref{sec:cc}).
As indicated by an $R^2$-value of $0.9995$, a good linear dependence is observed for the underlying data, confirming the validness of the theoretical model.
By identifying the parameters of the performed fit, values
\begin{align*}
	E_\text{g,0} = \SI{0.769(5)}{\eV} \\
	\text{y-intercept} = \num{50.909(86)} % whatever units
\end{align*}
are acquired.
The uncertainties are the result of an orthogonal distance regression.
As the lab manual does not provide error bounds of the instruments, the ODR is run without uncertainties provided.

Using the computed value for $E_\text{g,0}$ and the relation $E_\text{g}(T) = E_\text{g,0} -\upalpha T$ for the band gap energy, where $\upalpha=\SI{4e-4}{\eV\per\kelvin}$ is specified in the experiment manual, the band gap energy at \SI{300}{\kelvin}
\begin{equation*}
	E_\text{g}\left(T = \SI{300}{\kelvin}\right) = \SI{0.649(5)}{\eV}
\end{equation*}
is obtained.
This is within the range of the literature value of $E_\text{g}\left(T = \SI{300}{\kelvin}\right) = \text{\SIrange{0.66}{0.67}{\eV}}$, as stated in the manual.

The charge carrier density at $T = \SI{300}{\kelvin}$ is found by computing the value of the fit function at $\left(\SI{300}{\kelvin}\right)^{-1}$ and solving for $n_\text{i}$.

This gives an intrinsic charge carrier density of $n_\text{i} (T=\SI{300}{\kelvin}) = \SI{2.33 (45) e19}{\per\meter\cubed}$, which deviates from the literature value of $n_\text{i} (T=\SI{300}{\kelvin}) = \SI{2.4e13}{\per\centi\meter\cubed}$ by \SI{3}{\percent}, well within the measurement uncertainty.

\section{Comparison of Hall Mobilities}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{./data/plots/mob-comp.pdf}
  \captiond{Comparison of hall mobility for both samples}{}
  \label{fig:mob-comp}
\end{figure}

Hall mobility dependences for both samples are compared in \autoref{fig:mob-comp}.
Apart from their obviously different absolute values, it is easy to see that the curves exhibit different temperature dependencies for low temperatures (with respect to the observed temperature range).

\textbf{The germanium sample (A)} shows a temperature dependence which is in accordance with the theory outlined in \autoref{subsec:phonons}: For high temperatures, scattering at acoustic phonons makes a major contribution to the hall mobility $\left(\propto T^{-\nicefrac{3}{2}}\right)$.
For low temperatures, scattering at charged defects results in a $\propto T^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}$ behavior.

\textbf{The GaAs composite sample (B)} appears to show the expected behavior as well.
For this temperature regime, scattering at optical phonons should make the main contribution to the overall behavior so that a behavior like $\mu\propto \e^\frac{\hbar \omega}{k T} - 1$ is expected.
This assumption is confirmed by the observed data.
