\newcommand{\abstract}{A hall is a relatively large space enclosed by a roof and walls. Different types of halls have different effects on humans, this phenomenon is known as the \textit{hall effect}. In what follows, we introduce a generalized hall formalism of walls and roofs, ultimately leading to a Grand Unified Hall Theory (GUHT), which is able to describe halls in a general sense.}
